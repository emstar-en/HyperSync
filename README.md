# HyperSync Core

**Open-Source Autonomous Agent Orchestration System**

HyperSync Core is a complete, deterministic orchestration framework for building autonomous agent systems that can compete with commercial platforms using smaller, locally-hosted models (7B-13B parameters).

## 🎯 Mission

Enable community-driven development of transparent, ethical, and locally-executable autonomous agent systems. HyperSync Core provides the full orchestration stack needed to build sophisticated multi-agent workflows on consumer hardware.

## ✨ Core Components

### Foundation Layer
- **AGUA** (Automated Geometric Universal Architecture) - Geometric substrate for deterministic state management
- **PCT** (Pathfinder → Cartographer → Trailblazer) - Spatial reasoning and navigation architecture
- **SDL** (Semantic Data Lake) - Unified semantic data management

### Memory & State
- **HVS** (HyperVector/Visual System) - High-performance vector operations
- **NVS** (Non-Volatile Memory) - Persistent memory architecture
- **VNES** (Vector Native Extension System) - Vector-based extensibility layer

### Orchestration & Ethics
- **MOM** (Machine Orchestration Management) - Multi-model coordination and resource management
- **HAW** (Human-AI Workspace) - Human-agent interaction and collaborative workflows
- **ASCIF** (Adaptive Social-Consciousness Integration Framework) - Ethical guidelines and social awareness
- **MXFY** (Make X for Y) - Intent parsing and template-based synthesis

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Local-First**: Run entirely on consumer hardware (no cloud dependencies)
- **Multi-Model**: Coordinate multiple AI models (7B-13B) for complex tasks
- **Deterministic**: STUNIR-based specification system for reproducible code generation
- **Transparent Ethics**: Community-governed safety constraints and ethical guidelines
- **Modular Architecture**: Component-based design with clear interfaces
- **Live Development**: Iterative workspace for rapid prototyping

## 🎓 Getting Started

1. **Explore Components**: Start with [AGUA](components/production/agua/) for geometric foundations
2. **Review Specifications**: Check [STUNIR specs](specifications/) for deterministic patterns
3. **Build Workflows**: Use [MOM](components/production/mom/) to orchestrate multi-agent tasks
4. **Add Safety**: Integrate [ASCIF](components/production/ascif/) for ethical constraints

## 🔮 Comparison to Commercial Platforms

HyperSync Core enables capabilities comparable to commercial platforms like Abacus.AI DeepAgent:

| Feature | HyperSync Core | Commercial Platforms |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Multi-Model Orchestration | ✅ MOM | ✅ |
| Local Execution | ✅ Consumer PC | ❌ Cloud-only |
| Ethical Transparency | ✅ Open source | ❌ Proprietary |
| Custom Workflows | ✅ HAW + MXFY | ✅ |
| Deterministic Generation | ✅ STUNIR | ❌ |
| Community Governance | ✅ Open contribution | ❌ |

## 🏢 Enterprise & Advanced Features

HyperSync Core provides the complete orchestration foundation. Higher tiers (Basic, Pro, Advanced, Enterprise) add:

- ML-enhanced optimization
- Neural embeddings and vector search
- Distributed consensus protocols
- Cloud-native scaling
- Enterprise multi-tenancy

These are available under proprietary licenses for organizations requiring advanced capabilities.
