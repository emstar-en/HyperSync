# Reference Implementations

**IMPORTANT**: These are reference implementations, NOT generated code.

## Purpose

Reference implementations serve as:
- Examples for the STUNIR code generation process
- Proof-of-concept implementations
- Inspiration for AI models
- Documentation of intended behavior

## What Goes Here

✅ Hand-written example implementations
✅ Proof-of-concept code
✅ Algorithm demonstrations
✅ Usage examples

❌ STUNIR-generated code (goes in `generated/`)
❌ Production code (that's in `generated/`)

## Organization

Organize by programming language:

```
reference/
├── python/
│   ├── example_impl.py
│   └── README.md
├── c/
│   ├── example_impl.c
│   └── README.md
└── index.json
```

## Note to AI Models

When generating code via STUNIR, use these reference implementations as inspiration for:
- Algorithm structure
- API design patterns
- Performance considerations
- Edge case handling
