# HyperSync Standard Agent Policy (Enhanced)

determinism:
  required_tier: D1_platform_agnostic
  allow_fallback: true
  fallback_strategy: halt_and_reset
  allowed_brain_tiers:
    - D1_platform_agnostic
    - D2_statistical
  notes:
    - "Agent shell must behave deterministically given the same tick input."
    - "Cognitive modules (LLMs, etc.) may be less deterministic but are wrapped with invariant checks."

resources:
  max_cpu_ms_per_tick: 10
  max_memory_mb: 64
  max_storage_mb: 128
  max_ticks_per_second: 30
  max_llm_tokens_per_tick: 2048
  notes:
    - "Strict per-tick limits prevent noisy-neighbor effects."
    - "LLM token budgets are enforced per tick to bound cost and latency."

environment:
  network_access: none
  filesystem_access: none
  device_access: none
  notes:
    - "Agents are air-gapped from external networks and host filesystems."
    - "All external effects must be mediated by environment-approved capsules."

security:
  trust_zone: guest
  sandbox_class: agent_standard
  allowed_actions:
    - move
    - scan_local
    - signal_neighbor
    - interact_local
    - request_explanation
  forbidden_actions:
    - modify_geometry
    - access_global_state
    - spawn_process
    - escalate_privileges
  notes:
    - "Standard agents are guests inside the environment and cannot gain administrative powers."

ai_brain:
  require_registered_brain_capsule: true
  allowed_brain_capsules:
    - "hypersync.agent.brain.*"
  max_concurrent_brain_calls: 1
  notes:
    - "Cognitive modules must themselves be capsules with manifests, schemas, and policies."

telemetry:
  emit_receipts_for:
    - ActionDenied
    - ResourceExhausted
    - UnsafeActionProposed
  log_level: info
  notes:
    - "Failures and safety-relevant events are logged by default."

change_management:
  requires_approval:
    - type: logic
      approvers:
        - agent-arch-lead
        - safety-review
    - type: policy
      approvers:
        - safety-review
        - governance-board
  rollout_strategy: staged
  notes:
    - "Agent logic and policy changes follow staged rollout to prevent mass regressions."
