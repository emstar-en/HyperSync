# HyperSync Distribution & Licensing Model

## Philosophy: Buy the Spec, Build the Code

HyperSync adopts a radical "Spec-First" distribution model. When you purchase a license, you are not just buying a binary; you are buying access to the **Specification** for that tier and the **STUNIR** toolchain.

This empowers you to:
- **Generate** the HyperSync Core in *any* language (Rust, Python, C++, Go).
- **Compile** for *any* architecture (x86, ARM, RISC-V, WASM).
- **Integrate** directly into your hardware provisioning pipelines (Terraform, Ansible, PXE).

We provide pre-compiled binaries for convenience, but the true power lies in the Spec.

## Retail Tiers (One-Time Purchase)

These licenses are perpetual. You own the version you buy.
