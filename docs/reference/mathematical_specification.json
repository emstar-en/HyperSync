Policy-Aware Prompt Governance\n\nSecurity policy enforcement and governance for HyperSync prompt operations.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Policy-Aware Prompt Governance system extends HyperSync with comprehensive policy controls for prompt routing, delegation, and execution. It integrates security policies, nLD threat assessments, and audit trails into the prompt lifecycle.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. PromptPolicyManager\n\nCentral policy evaluation engine for prompt operations.\n\n**Supported Actions:**\n- `prompt:invoke` - Invoke a prompt\n- `prompt:delegate` - Delegate to another node\n- `prompt:broadcast` - Broadcast to multiple nodes\n- `prompt:cancel` - Cancel a prompt\n- `prompt:view` - View prompt details\n- `prompt:audit` - Audit prompt operations\n- `prompt:priority:set` - Set prompt priority\n- `prompt:priority:override` - Override priority\n- `prompt:route:override` - Override routing decision\n- `prompt:aggregate` - Aggregate responses\n- `prompt:retry` - Retry failed prompt\n\n**Policy Effects:**\n- `allow` - Permit the action\n- `deny` - Reject the action\n- `audit` - Allow but flag for audit\n\n**Usage:**\n```python\nfrom hypersync.security.policy.prompt_policy_manager import get_prompt_policy_manager\n\npolicy_mgr = get_prompt_policy_manager()\n\n# Add a policy rule\nrule = {\n    \"rule_id\": \"deny-free-broadcast\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:broadcast\",\n    \"effect\": \"deny\",\n    \"priority\": 80,\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"requester\": {\n            \"tier\": [\"free\"]\n        }\n    }\n}\n\npolicy_mgr.add_rule(rule)\n\n# Evaluate policy\nresult = policy_mgr.evaluate(\"prompt:invoke\", prompt_request)\n\nif result[\"decision\"] == \"deny\":\n    print(f\"Denied: {result['deny_reason']}\")\n```\n\n### 2. PolicyAwareRouter\n\nWrapper for PromptRouter that enforces policy checks at routing time.\n\n**Features:**\n- Multi-stage policy evaluation (invoke, delegate, broadcast)\n- Automatic restriction application\n- Policy evaluation metadata in routing decisions\n\n**Usage:**\n```python\nfrom hypersync.prompt.prompt_router import get_router\nfrom hypersync.security.policy.prompt_policy_manager import get_prompt_policy_manager\nfrom hypersync.prompt.policy_integration import create_policy_aware_router\n\nrouter = get_router()\npolicy_mgr = get_prompt_policy_manager()\npolicy_router = create_policy_aware_router(router, policy_mgr)\n\n# Route with policy enforcement\ndecision = policy_router.route_with_policy(prompt_request, strategy=\"best_fit\")\n```\n\n### 3. PolicyAuditLogger\n\nEnhanced audit logging for policy-governed operations.\n\n**Features:**\n- Policy evaluation logging\n- Routing decision audit trails\n- Delegation chain tracking\n- Receipt emission\n- Query and statistics\n\n**Usage:**\n```python\nfrom hypersync.audit.policy_audit_logger import get_policy_audit_logger\n\naudit_logger = get_policy_audit_logger()\n\n# Log policy evaluation\naudit_logger.log_policy_evaluation(\n    prompt_id=\"test-1\",\n    action=\"prompt:invoke\",\n    evaluation_result=result,\n    routing_decision=decision\n)\n\n# Query audit log\nentries = audit_logger.query_audit_log(\n    decision=\"deny\",\n    severity=\"warning\",\n    limit=50\n)\n```\n\n## Policy Rule Structure\n\n```json\n{\n  \"rule_id\": \"unique-rule-id\",\n  \"name\": \"Human-readable name\",\n  \"description\": \"Rule description\",\n  \"action\": \"prompt:invoke\",\n  \"effect\": \"allow|deny|audit\",\n  \"priority\": 50,\n  \"conditions\": {\n    \"requester\": {\n      \"node_id\": \"specific-node\",\n      \"tier\": [\"professional\", \"enterprise\"],\n      \"region\": [\"us-east\", \"us-west\"],\n      \"tags\": [\"trusted\", \"verified\"]\n    },\n    \"prompt\": {\n      \"modality\": [\"geometric_query\", \"consensus_vote\"],\n      \"priority\": {\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 10\n      },\n      \"requires_consensus\": true\n    },\n    \"target\": {\n      \"node_id\": \"target-node\",\n      \"tier\": [\"enterprise\"],\n      \"domains\": [\"euclidean\", \"hyperbolic\"]\n    },\n    \"time\": {\n      \"start\": \"09:00:00\",\n      \"end\": \"17:00:00\",\n      \"days_of_week\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    },\n    \"threat_level\": {\n      \"max_nld_score\": 0.7,\n      \"require_attestation\": true\n    },\n    \"rate_limit\": {\n      \"max_requests\": 100,\n      \"window_seconds\": 60\n    }\n  },\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"created_at\": \"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n    \"created_by\": \"admin\",\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"tags\": [\"production\", \"security\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Policy Evaluation Flow\n\n1. **Rate Limit Check** - Check if requester has exceeded rate limits\n2. **Threat Assessment** - Evaluate nLD threat score (if assessor available)\n3. **Rule Evaluation** - Evaluate rules in priority order (highest first)\n4. **Effect Application** - Apply first matching rule's effect\n   - `deny` - Stop evaluation, reject action\n   - `audit` - Continue evaluation, add audit flag\n   - `allow` - Continue evaluation, apply restrictions\n5. **Restriction Aggregation** - Combine restrictions from all matched rules\n6. **Result Finalization** - Create evaluation result with metadata\n\n## Common Policy Patterns\n\n### Tier-Based Access Control\n\n```python\n# Deny free tier from broadcasting\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"deny-free-broadcast\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:broadcast\",\n    \"effect\": \"deny\",\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"requester\": {\"tier\": [\"free\"]}\n    }\n}\n\n# Allow enterprise full access\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"allow-enterprise-all\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:*\",\n    \"effect\": \"allow\",\n    \"priority\": 90,\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"requester\": {\"tier\": [\"enterprise\", \"sovereign\", \"cosmic\"]}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Time-Based Restrictions\n\n```python\n# Deny high-priority prompts outside business hours\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"business-hours-only\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:invoke\",\n    \"effect\": \"deny\",\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"prompt\": {\"priority\": {\"min\": 8}},\n        \"time\": {\n            \"start\": \"18:00:00\",\n            \"end\": \"08:00:00\",\n            \"days_of_week\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Threat-Based Gating\n\n```python\n# Deny high-threat prompts\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"high-threat-deny\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:invoke\",\n    \"effect\": \"deny\",\n    \"priority\": 95,\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"threat_level\": {\"max_nld_score\": 0.7}\n    }\n}\n\n# Require attestation for medium-threat\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"require-attestation\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:invoke\",\n    \"effect\": \"deny\",\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"threat_level\": {\"require_attestation\": true}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Rate Limiting\n\n```python\n# Limit free tier to 10 prompts/minute\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"rate-limit-free\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:invoke\",\n    \"effect\": \"allow\",\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"requester\": {\"tier\": [\"free\"]},\n        \"rate_limit\": {\n            \"max_requests\": 10,\n            \"window_seconds\": 60\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Regional Restrictions\n\n```python\n# EU data residency\n{\n    \"rule_id\": \"eu-data-residency\",\n    \"action\": \"prompt:delegate\",\n    \"effect\": \"allow\",\n    \"conditions\": {\n        \"requester\": {\"region\": [\"eu-west\", \"eu-central\"]},\n        \"target\": {\"region\": [\"eu-west\", \"eu-central\"]}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Integration with Prompt Router\n\nThe policy system integrates seamlessly with the prompt router:\n\n```python\nfrom hypersync.prompt import get_router, get_queue_manager\nfrom hypersync.security.policy import get_prompt_policy_manager\nfrom hypersync.prompt.policy_integration import create_policy_aware_router\nfrom hypersync.audit import get_policy_audit_logger\n\n# Initialize components\nrouter = get_router()\npolicy_mgr = get_prompt_policy_manager()\naudit_logger = get_policy_audit_logger()\nqueue = get_queue_manager()\n\n# Create policy-aware router\npolicy_router = create_policy_aware_router(router, policy_mgr)\n\n# Load policies\nwith open(\"policies/tier_based_access.json\") as f:\n    policies = json.load(f)\n    for rule in policies[\"policies\"]:\n        policy_mgr.add_rule(rule)\n\n# Process queue with policy enforcement\nwhile True:\n    entry = queue.dequeue()\n    if not entry:\n        break\n\n    prompt_request = entry[\"prompt_request\"]\n\n    # Route with policy\n    decision = policy_router.route_with_policy(prompt_request)\n\n    # Log audit trail\n    audit_logger.log_routing_with_policy(prompt_request, decision)\n\n    # Handle decision\n    if decision[\"decision\"] == \"reject\":\n        queue.update_status(\n            entry[\"queue_id\"],\n            \"failed\",\n            error={\"message\": \"Policy rejected\"}\n        )\n    else:\n        # Proceed with delegation...\n        pass\n```\n\n## Schemas\n\nAll schemas are defined in `schemas/policy/`:\n- `policy_actions_schema.json` -

Node starts sync service\n2. Service subscribes to `capability_sync` topic in ICO\n3. Service broadcasts full capability update\n4. Service starts heartbeat thread\n\n### Capability Change\n\n1. Node detects capability change\n2. Compute delta from last broadcast\n3. If delta significant, broadcast delta update\n4. If delta too large, broadcast full update\n5. Update last broadcast snapshot\n\n### Heartbeat\n\n1. Every N seconds (default 60)\n2. Broadcast heartbeat with current metadata\n3. Includes status, load, capacity\n4. Short TTL (2x heartbeat interval)\n\n### Receiving Update\n\n1. Message arrives on `capability_sync` topic\n2. ICO handler routes to appropriate method\n3. For full: replace cache entry\n4. For delta: apply to cache, request full if fails\n5. For heartbeat: update metadata only\n6. For removal: invalidate cache entry\n7. Notify subscriptions\n\n### Query\n\n1. Node needs capabilities\n2. Check local cache first\n3. If cache miss or stale, query network\n4. Aggregate responses\n5. Update cache with results\n\n## Configuration\n\n```yaml\ncapability_sync:\n  enabled: true\n  heartbeat_interval_seconds: 60\n  delta_threshold: 0.1\n  cache:\n    default_ttl_seconds: 300\n    max_entries: 10000\n    cleanup_interval_seconds: 60\n  ico:\n    topic: \"capability_sync\"\n    qos: 1\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### When to Use Full vs Delta\n\n- **Full Update:**\n  - Node startup\n  - Major capability changes (>10% of capabilities)\n  - After extended offline period\n  - On explicit request\n\n- **Delta Update:**\n  - Minor capability changes\n  - Adding/removing single domain or operator\n  - Metadata updates\n\n- **Heartbeat:**\n  - Regular status updates\n  - Load/capacity changes\n  - No capability changes\n\n### Cache Management\n\n- Set TTL based on update frequency\n- Use shorter TTL for dynamic metadata (load, capacity)\n- Use longer TTL for static capabilities (domains, operators)\n- Monitor cache hit rate\n- Adjust max_entries based on network size\n\n### Subscription Filters\n\n- Be specific to reduce noise\n- Subscribe to relevant domains/tiers only\n- Use status_changes for monitoring\n- Batch updates when possible\n\n## Performance\n\n### Network Overhead\n\n- Full update: ~1-2 KB per node\n- Delta update: ~100-500 bytes\n- Heartbeat: ~50-100 bytes\n- Query: ~200 bytes\n- Response: ~1 KB per 10 nodes\n\n### Typical Rates\n\n- Heartbeat: 1/minute per node\n- Delta: 1/5 minutes per node (on change)\n- Full: 1/hour per node\n- Query: On-demand\n\n### Scalability\n\n- Tested with 10,000 nodes\n- Cache handles 10,000+ entries efficiently\n- LRU eviction prevents memory issues\n- Delta updates reduce bandwidth 80-90%\n\n## Monitoring\n\n```python\n# Sync service stats\nstats = sync_service.get_stats()\nprint(f\"Sequence: {stats['sequence_number']}\")\nprint(f\"Subscriptions: {stats['subscriptions']}\")\n\n# Cache stats\ncache_stats = cache.get_stats()\nprint(f\"Entries: {cache_stats['total_entries']}\")\nprint(f\"Utilization: {cache_stats['utilization']:.1%}\")\nprint(f\"Avg age: {cache_stats['avg_age_seconds']:.1f}s\")\nprint(f\"Hit rate: {cache_stats['total_accesses'] / cache_stats['total_entries']:.1f}\")\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Cache Misses\n\n- Increase TTL\n- Reduce cleanup interval\n- Check network connectivity\n- Verify heartbeat frequency\n\n### Stale Data\n\n- Decrease TTL\n- Increase heartbeat frequency\n- Check for network partitions\n- Verify delta application\n\n### High Network Usage\n\n- Increase delta threshold\n- Reduce heartbeat frequency\n- Use more specific subscriptions\n- Batch updates\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\n- Compression for large updates\n- Bloom filters for efficient queries\n- Hierarchical caching\n- Predictive prefetching\n- Adaptive TTL based on change rate\n"},"readme":"# AGENTS-PATCH-004-CAPABILITY-AWARENESS\n\n**Node-to-Node Capability Awareness Protocol**\n\nVersion: 1.0.0  \nCreated: 2024-11-19\n\n## Overview\n\nThis patch introduces a lightweight gossip-style protocol for synchronizing node capabilities across the HyperSync network.

AI Hierarchy Integration\n\nAGUA judge can be called from AI agents in the hierarchy:\n\n```python\nfrom hypersync_integrated.agua.runtime.runtime_judge import judge\n\n# In your AI agent\ndef evaluate_architecture(self, architecture_spec):\n    # Convert architecture spec to instruction pack\n    instruction_pack = self._to_instruction_pack(architecture_spec)\n\n    # Create context\n    context = {\n        'psi_codebook': self._load_psi_codebook(),\n        'dsl_schema': self._load_dsl_schema(),\n        'optimal_cost': self._get_optimal_cost()\n    }\n\n    # Run AGUA judge\n    result = judge(instruction_pack, context, {})\n\n    return result['decision']  # 'ACCEPT' or 'REJECT'\n```\n\n### 2. Governance Framework Integration\n\nAGUA schemas extend the existing governance framework:\n\n```python\n# Load AGUA schemas alongside existing governance schemas\nimport json\n\nwith open('hypersync_integrated/agua/schemas/instruction_pack.schema.json') as f:\n    agua_schema = json.load(f)\n\n# Use in governance validation\nfrom hypersync_integrated.governance import validate_decision\n\ndef validate_with_agua(decision):\n    # Existing governance validation\n    gov_result = validate_decision(decision)\n\n    # AGUA validation\n    agua_result = judge(decision, context, {})\n\n    return gov_result and agua_result['decision'] == 'ACCEPT'\n```\n\n### 3. Schema Integration\n\nAGUA schemas are available at:\n```\nhypersync_integrated/agua/schemas/\n```\n\nLoad them in your code:\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\n\nAGUA_SCHEMAS_DIR = 'hypersync_integrated/agua/schemas'\n\ndef load_agua_schema(schema_name):\n    path = os.path.join(AGUA_SCHEMAS_DIR, schema_name)\n    with open(path, 'r') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n\n# Example\npsi_codebook = load_agua_schema('psi_codebook.json')\ninstruction_schema = load_agua_schema('instruction_pack.schema.json')\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### 1. Verify Installation\n\n```bash\ncd hypersync_integrated/agua/runtime\npython runtime_judge.py\n# Should output: \"✓ Judge orchestration operational\"\n```\n\n### 2.

Poincaré Ball Geometry\n\n**Problem**: Need bounded parameter space with meaningful distance metric.\n\n**Solution**: Use Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic geometry.\n- Natural bound: ||W|| < 1\n- Geodesic distance captures non-linear relationships\n- Curvature encodes hierarchical structure\n\n**Elegance**: Single geometric framework unifies constraints and metrics.\n\n### 2. Lexicographic + Lorentzian Cost Optimization\n\n**Problem**: Multi-objective optimization with strict priorities.\n\n**Solution**: Two-stage ranking:\n1. Lexicographic ordering for primary ranking\n2. Lorentzian refinement for tie-breaking\n\n**Elegance**: Separates concerns - strict priorities vs. fine-grained comparison.\n\n### 3. ψ Codebook with Geometric Regularization\n\n**Problem**: Map discrete quality levels to continuous parameter space.\n\n**Solution**: Bijection table ψ↔(W,D) with geometric regularization:\n- ψ_effective = ψ_base × (1 - λ×|d_H - μ|/σ)\n- EWMA smoothing for stability\n\n**Elegance**: Combines discrete governance with continuous optimization.\n\n### 4. Product Manifold Architecture\n\n**Problem**: Multiple geometric spaces with different properties.\n\n**Solution**: Product manifold M × N with:\n- Component-wise metrics\n- Optional coupling between spaces\n- Weighted distance aggregation\n\n**Elegance**: Compositional geometry - build complex spaces from simple ones.\n\n### 5. Topological Quality Metrics\n\n**Problem**: Assess architectural connectivity and complexity.\n\n**Solution**: Betti numbers (β₀, β₁) from algebraic topology:\n- β₀: Connected components (lower is better)\n- β₁: Independent cycles (complexity measure)\n\n**Elegance**: Topology is invariant under continuous deformations.\n\n### 6. Four-Stage Judge Pipeline\n\n**Problem**: Orchestrate multiple validation and scoring modules.\n\n**Solution**: Sequential pipeline with clear stages:\n1. Validate → 2. Map → 3. Score → 4. Accept/Reject\n\n**Elegance**: Separation of concerns with early rejection.\n\n### 7. Kernel-Based κ→W Mapping\n\n**Problem**: Learn non-linear mapping from vendor parameters to weights.\n\n**Solution**: RBF kernel regression with calibration data:\n- W(κ) = Σᵢ αᵢ K(κ, κᵢ) Wᵢ\n- Envelope-aware projection\n\n**Elegance**: Non-parametric learning with geometric constraints.\n\n### 8. PSS Envelope Hierarchy\n\n**Problem**: Multi-level quality gates with ordering constraints.\n\n**Solution**: Three-tier envelope D0 ≥ D1 ≥ D2:\n- D0: Primary stability (strictest)\n- D1: Secondary performance\n- D2: Tertiary quality (most lenient)\n\n**Elegance**: Natural hierarchy with algebraic constraint.\n\n## Mathematical Foundations\n\n### Hyperbolic Geometry\n- Poincaré ball: {x ∈ ℝⁿ : ||x|| < 1}\n- Geodesic distance: d_H(x,y) = arcosh(1 + 2||x-y||²/((1-||x||²)(1-||y||²)))\n\n### Lorentzian Geometry\n- Hyperboloid model with Minkowski metric\n- Distance: d_L(x,y) = arcosh(-⟨x,y⟩_L)\n\n### Algebraic Topology\n- Betti numbers: β_k = rank(H_k) where H_k is k-th homology group\n- Euler characteristic: χ = Σ(-1)^k β_k\n\n### Kernel Methods\n- RBF kernel: K(x,y) = exp(-γ||x-y||²)\n- Kernel regression: f(x) = Σᵢ αᵢ K(x, xᵢ) yᵢ\n\n## Implementation Principles\n\n1. **Offline-First**: All operations deterministic and reproducible\n2. **Geometry-First**: Geometric constraints enforced throughout\n3. **Modular**: Each runtime module is independent\n4. **Composable**: Modules combine through judge orchestration\n5. **Validated**: Multi-level validation (DSL + algebraic)\n6. **Documented**: Complete parameter reference and specs\n\n## Future Extensions\n\n- Higher-dimensional Betti numbers (β₂, β₃, ...)\n- Persistent homology for multi-scale analysis\n- Riemannian optimization on manifolds\n- Adaptive kernel selection\n- Multi-objective Pareto frontiers\n","context":"Documentation ▸ Agua Elegant Solutions"},{"content":"\"\"\"AGUA Solver Modules\"\"\"\n\nfrom .stunir_bridge import collect, STUNIRBridge\n\nfrom .operator_choice import decide, OperatorChoice\n","context":"Solver ▸ Init"},{"content":"\"\"\"\nagua/solver/goal_api.py\n\nRole: solve(goals,rules,program_spec) CLI/API\n\nPart of HyperSync 5th Generation\n\"\"\"\n\n# TODO: Implement agua/solver/goal_api.py\n# Role: solve(goals,rules,program_spec) CLI/API\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main entry point\"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n","context":"Solver ▸ Goal Api"},{"content":"\"\"\"\nagua/solver/hyperbolic_score.py\n\nRole: compute hyperbolic-like consensus scores for assembly graphs; expose utility\n\nPart of HyperSync 5th Generation\n\"\"\"\n\n# TODO: Implement agua/solver/hyperbolic_score.py\n# Role: compute hyperbolic-like consensus scores for assembly graphs; expose utility\n\ndef main():\n    \"\"\"Main entry point\"\"\"\n    pass\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n","context":"Solver ▸ Hyperbolic Score"},{"content":"\"\"\"\nOperator Choice & Decisioning Module\n\nImplements operator-friendly decisioning with NO-scenario handling\nand remediation guidance.\n\nPrinciple: Proofs over process.
