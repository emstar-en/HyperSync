# STUNIR - Standardization Theorem Unique Normal Intermediate Reference

## Overview
STUNIR is a **General-Purpose AI Build Toolchain**. It is not part of HyperSync; rather, HyperSync is *built using* STUNIR.

## Purpose
STUNIR solves the problem of "Drift" in AI-generated software.
- **Input:** A loose collection of natural language specs and schemas.
- **Process:** STUNIR converts these into a **Unique Normal Form (IR)**.
- **Output:** Deterministic, verifiable source code.

## Role in HyperSync
HyperSync uses STUNIR to ensure that its complex geometric logic and consensus rules are implemented exactly as specified, without AI hallucination or "creative interpretation" during the build process.
