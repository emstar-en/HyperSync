# HyperSync Vision & Philosophy

## The Problem
Traditional distributed systems rely on discrete, binary consensus mechanisms (Raft, Paxos) that are brittle at scale and lack "context." They treat all nodes as equal and all failures as binary.

## The Solution: Geometric Orchestration
HyperSync reimagines distributed coordination as a physics problem.
-   **Agents are Particles**: They have position, momentum, and "mass" (compute capacity).
-   **Tasks are Gravity Wells**: They pull agents towards them.
-   **Consensus is Equilibrium**: The system naturally settles into a stable state through geometric forces.

## The "Why"
We are building this to enable **Autonomous AI Swarms** that can coordinate without a central commander. By embedding logic into the geometry of the space itself, we allow thousands of agents to self-organize organically.

## Success Criteria
1.  **Scale**: Support 10,000+ agents in a single manifold.
2.  **Resilience**: Survive 33% Byzantine faults without halting.
3.  **Explainability**: Every decision can be visualized as a geometric path.
