# HyperSync Purpose

## Core Mission

HyperSync is a geometry-aware orchestration and synchronization system designed to manage distributed computational workloads using hyperbolic geometry principles.

## Primary Goals

1. **Deterministic Orchestration**: Ensure predictable, reproducible behavior across distributed systems
2. **Geometric Efficiency**: Leverage hyperbolic geometry for efficient representation of hierarchical data
3. **Transparent Operation**: Provide complete visibility into system behavior and decisions
4. **Verifiable Computation**: Enable cryptographic proof of all transformations and operations

## Use Cases

- Distributed AI model coordination
- Hierarchical data synchronization
- Multi-agent system orchestration
- Deterministic workflow execution
- Verifiable computation pipelines

## Design Philosophy

HyperSync is built on the principle that complex distributed systems can be modeled more efficiently in hyperbolic space than Euclidean space, particularly for hierarchical and tree-like structures.
