### 9. Dynamic Model Orchestration (Factory & Catalogue)
- **JIT Capability Factory:** Implements the "Make X for Y" protocol, compiling user intents into VNES-compatible capsules.
- **Local Intelligence Registry (Catalogue):** Manages local LLMs/SLMs and routes inference tasks with deterministic accountancy.
- **VNES Integration:** Both Factory and Catalogue operate as Vector Capsules, emitting and consuming VNES receipts for full auditability.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automated setup, validation, and injection of generated capsules into the runtime environment.
