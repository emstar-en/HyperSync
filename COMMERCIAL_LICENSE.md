# HyperSync Commercial License Terms

## Overview
This document outlines the terms for the commercial use of HyperSync, covering both the proprietary service tiers and the commercial licensing option for the Core technology.

## 1. Proprietary Service Tiers
The following components and services are proprietary and are **NOT** licensed under the AGPLv3. They are available only through a valid commercial subscription or partner agreement:

*   **Basic Tier:** Priority access, cloud hosting, standard capsule library.
*   **Pro Tier:** Collaboration tools, advanced capsules, API access.
*   **Advanced Tier:** Dedicated infrastructure, SLA support, custom development.
*   **Quartermaster Tier:** Enterprise-grade solutions delivered via Licensed Partners. Includes SLO+ attestations, hardened security environments, and managed deployment services.

Unauthorized copying, distribution, or reverse engineering of these proprietary components is strictly prohibited.

## 2. Commercial License for Core (Dual Licensing)
While the HyperSync Core is available under the AGPLv3, we understand that some organizations may wish to integrate the Core into their proprietary solutions without the copyleft obligations (e.g., the requirement to release source code of the entire application).

For these use cases, the HyperSync Foundation offers a **Commercial Core License**. This license allows you to:
*   Embed HyperSync Core into closed-source applications.
*   Modify the Core without releasing your changes.
*   Distribute your application without AGPL restrictions.

## 3. Agreement
By purchasing a subscription or entering into a Partner Agreement for the Quartermaster tier, you agree to be bound by the HyperSync Master Services Agreement (MSA).
