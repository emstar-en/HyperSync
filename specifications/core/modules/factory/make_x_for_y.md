# Make X for Y Model (Factory)

This module assembles storage, memory, security, policy, and CI/CD for any target model using typed inputs:
- ModelProfile
- FactorySpec
- MinderProposal
- ClearanceCapsule

Invariants:
- deny-by-default, tighten-only policy evolution
- numeric safety: curvature scaling, exp/log round-trip, holonomy bounds
- receipts canonicalization for proposals/builds/deploys
- multi-sig for sensitive scopes; no raw vectors/distances off box
