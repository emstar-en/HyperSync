# AGPL Service Use — Engineer FAQ (Non-Legal)

Q: When does AGPL apply?
A: If the AGPL-licensed server code is used to provide a network service, users of that service are entitled to the complete corresponding source.

Q: Can third-parties avoid AGPL?
A: Yes, by clean-room reimplementation (no copying), or by not using AGPL code at all.

Q: Does AGPL cover specs and formats?
A: No—facts, ideas, and formats are generally not covered; the license covers the code and derivative works of that code.

Q: Why dual-license?
A: AGPL encourages openness; commercial license enables proprietary integrations without open-sourcing.
