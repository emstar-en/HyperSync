# Conformance Profiles and Trademark Policy (Outline)

Purpose: Permit "HyperSync-compatible" branding only for implementations that pass defined profiles.

Profiles (examples):
- Profile A (Public): functional + wire format conformance.
- Profile B (Performance KPIs): latency, determinism, memory at set tolerances.
- Profile C (Security Baseline): LD-1.0 policies enabled and verifiable.

Brand Use:
- Allowed phrases and logo usage conditional on passing profiles and signing a trademark license.
- Prohibited misleading claims.

Process: submission, test harness execution, results publication, appeal path.
This is a template; counsel to finalize and register marks.
