# IP Strategy Candidates (Engineering Perspective)

Candidates for narrow, implementation-specific patents (subject to counsel review):
1. Invariant-preserving compaction/repair algorithm with provable holonomy/distance bounds.
2. Deterministic receipts pipeline with bitwise canonicalization across shards and failovers.
3. Fused intrinsic kernels for curvature-scaled exp/log+retraction with stability clamps and dynamic promotion.
4. Storeless promotion/demotion mechanism tied to receipt-derived thresholds.

Trade secret candidates: numeric-policy thresholds, topology/shard heuristics, SRE runbooks.
