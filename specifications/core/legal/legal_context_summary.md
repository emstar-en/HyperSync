# Legal Context Summary (Engineer Framing)

- AGPL discourages direct reuse in proprietary services but cannot prevent clean-room reimplementation of public specs.
- Engineering moat centers on optimized implementations, determinism, and KPIs baked into conformance profiles.
- Trademark+conformance and selective IP can raise the cost of faithful replication.

For legal positions and enforceability, defer to counsel.
