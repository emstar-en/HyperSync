# Legal Packet (For Counsel)

This folder provides engineers-and-counsel friendly materials.

Notes:
- This is not legal advice; these are engineering artifacts to assist counsel.
- Specs, schemas, and data formats may be licensed differently from code.
- We propose dual licensing for the reference server and permissive licenses for clients/specs.

Key files:
- legal/licensing_layout.json — proposed component-by-component license map.
- legal/licensing_matrix.json — at-a-glance matrix for counsel.
- legal/agpl_service_use_faq.md — engineer-facing FAQ about AGPL obligations.
- legal/conformance_and_trademark_policy.md — draft outline for compatibility branding.
- legal/ip_strategy_candidates.md — engineering list of non-obvious mechanisms that may merit patents.
- legal/legal_context_summary.md — rationale and assumptions (engineer-perspective).
- specs/conformance_kpis.json — measurable KPIs for compatibility profiles.
